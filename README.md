# Plus4U++ aka p4u-worklogger
Plus4U work log enhancement

***

## At the moment
Browser user script which enhances the Plus4U work log page.
- Loads and displays summary of a a JIRA issue, whose key is mentioned in the work description, as a link
- Writes a work log record directly into JIRA the moment it is created at the Plus4U work log page.

## In the future
Thanks to JIRA REST API flexibility, the user script may integrate JIRA issue tracker into the Plus4U work log page much more tightly.
Feel free to suggest new features at [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/bubblefoil/p4u-worklogger/issues).
